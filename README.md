### Breast Tumor Classifier - Harnessing Machine Learning for Histopathological Image Classification

#### Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using histopathological images. The process includes data collection, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
